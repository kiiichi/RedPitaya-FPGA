If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP i_scope/i_dfilt1_cha/bb_mult multiplier stage i_scope/i_dfilt1_cha/bb_mult/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net i_daisy/txp_dv_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin i_daisy/txp_dv_reg_i_2/O, cell i_daisy/txp_dv_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
